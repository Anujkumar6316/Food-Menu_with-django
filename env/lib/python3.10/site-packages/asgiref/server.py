class StatelessServer:
    """
    Base server class that handles basic concepts like application instance
    creation/pooling, exception handling, and similar, for stateless protocols
    (i.e. ones without actual incoming connections to the process)

    Your code should override the `handle` method, doing whatever it needs to,
    and calling `get_or_create_application_instance` with a unique `scope_id`
    and `scope` for the scope it wants to get.

    If an application instance is found with the same `scope_id`, you are
    given its input queue, otherwise one is made for you with the scope provided
    and you are given that fresh new input queue. Either way, you should do
    something like:

    input_queue = self.get_or_create_application_instance(
        "user-123456",
        {"type": "testprotocol", "user_id": "123456", "username": "andrew"},
    )
    input_queue.put_nowait(message)

    If you try and create an application instance and there are already
    `max_application` instances, the oldest/least recently used one will be
    reclaimed and shut down to make space.

    Application coroutines that error will be found periodically (every 100ms
    by default) and have their exceptions printed to the console. Override
    `application_exception` if you want to do more when this happens.

    If you override `run`, make sure you handle things like launching the
    application checker.
